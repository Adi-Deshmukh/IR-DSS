## 🧮 MILP Model Implementation

### Mathematical Formulation

Our implementation follows the Törnquist & Persson model with these key components:

#### **Sets**
- `T`: Set of trains
- `B`: Set of segments (lines and stations)
- `E`: Set of events (train-segment pairs)
- `P_j`: Set of tracks on segment j

#### **Variables**
- `x^begin_k`: Start time of event k
- `x^end_k`: End time of event k
- `z_k`: Delay of event k
- `y_{k,p}`: Binary track assignment
- `x_{k,k'}`: Binary ordering variables

#### **Constraints**
1. **Sequencing**: Consecutive events for same train
2. **Duration**: Minimum travel/dwell times
3. **Separation**: Safety headways between trains
4. **Track assignment**: One track per event
5. **Train length**: Physical constraints

#### **Objectives**
- **Objective 1a**: Minimize total delay
- **Objective 1b**: Minimize weighted costs

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Strategy 1**: No order changes (fastest)
2. **Strategy 2**: Implicit ordering
3. **Strategy 3**: Limited swaps (recommended)
4. **Strategy 4**: Full reordering (most flexible)

## 📊 Demo Workflow

The demo demonstrates this complete workflow:

### 1. **Initial Status Check**
- System efficiency: ~95-100%
- All trains on time
- No pending decisions

### 2. **Apply Disruption**
- 20-minute delay to Train 12614 (high priority)
- System efficiency drops
- Propagation effects begin

### 3. **Run MILP Optimization**
- Compute optimal rescheduling
- Generate optimization decisions
- Auto-apply low-impact changes
- Queue high-impact decisions for approval

### 4. **Admin Decision Review**
- Review pending decisions
- Analyze impact (delay changes, network effects)
- Approve/reject based on operational constraints

### 5. **Results Analysis**
- Delay reduction achieved
- System efficiency improvement
- Performance recommendations

## 📈 Expected Results

### Performance Metrics
- **Delay Reduction**: 15-30% typical improvement
- **Computation Time**: 2-10 seconds for 15 trains
- **Decision Quality**: Proven optimal solutions
- **System Efficiency**: Restored to 85-95%
